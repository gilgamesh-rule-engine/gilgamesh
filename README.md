Gilgamesh, the Groovy Rule Engine
  
  Following in the spirit of Grails and Griffon, Gilgamesh aims to simplify Rete-Based Rule creation by utilizing the concepts of convention over configuration, inversion of control, and the separation of concerns.  Gilgamesh follows current industry standards when it comes to rule writing and design as it is heavily influenced by the Drools project from JBoss.org.
  
  Gilgamesh features standardized integration points following the plugin model from Griffon/Grails and utilizes advances from those projects for maximum effect.  A GUI designed by leveraging Griffon is provided as a side project to quickly and efficiently create business rules.
  
  Side projects include the previously mentioned GUI, GORM integration for different Database types(RDBMS and NoSQL), automatic REST service points and integration points for Spring, Camel, Mule, and other technologies
  
  Gilgamesh is designed from the ground up to take advantage of functional programming techniques and the actor model of programming to scale both vertically and horizontally.  It utilizes the advances from the AKKA project to be able to do so.
  
  Gilgamesh is designed to get your Team up and running, creating rules, within minutes of install.
